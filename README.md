### Before the workshop begins

Parts of this workshop will be interactive. That is, you will fit Bayesian models on your own computers. To take advantage of these activities, please have the following installed on your computer before the start of the workshop:

* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* The `rstan` and `MCMCvis` packages
  * Detailed instructions for installing the `rstan` package can be found [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started)
  * The [Stan forums](https://discourse.mc-stan.org) are a useful resource to help troubleshoot package installation issues
